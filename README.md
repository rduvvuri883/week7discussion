•	What problem does a “serverless” database like Athena solve?

Athena can be used to run ad-hoc queries using ANSI SQL, without the need to aggregate or load the data into Athena. 
It helps in analyzing all formats of data that is stored in Amazon S3.
It integrates with Amazon Quick Sight for easy data visualization. Its capability to integrate with the AWS Glue Data Catalog provides centralized metadata store available throughout one’s AWS account
